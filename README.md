# Solar-System-Explorer

This project is an interactive 3D solar system visualization built using Three.js that creates an immersive educational experience. The simulation features accurate representations of all eight planets with proper scaling and orbital mechanics, complete with a detailed sun displaying corona effects and dynamic glowing, realistic moon systems, an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, comets with directional tails, twinkling stars, and distant rotating galaxies. The visualization incorporates sophisticated visual effects including day/night cycles on planets based on their position relative to the sun, dynamic sun glow and corona animations, realistic planet textures, atmospheric effects, and visible orbital paths. Users can interact with the system through orbit controls for zooming, panning, and rotating the view, while an information panel appears when hovering over objects, providing comprehensive details about each celestial body's classification, orbital characteristics, physical properties, and interesting facts. The technical implementation leverages Three.js for 3D rendering, employs raycasting for object selection, implements complex material systems, and features proper lighting with a point light for the sun and ambient light for general illumination. The project also includes responsive design elements and an animation speed control slider, making it both an educational tool and an engaging way to explore the solar system.
